<!--
  Custom Tableau workbooks can be placed alongside this config and they will be output at runtime if their dependencies are met.
  Plugin dependencies must be declared for any plugins that generate a table that the custom workbook relies on.
  To get a list of eligible plugin dependency names, invoke Logshark with the "listplugins" command line flag.
